.TH LIBICEBLOCK 3
.SH libiceblock
libiceblock - Serial interface library for ECUs that speak the KWP-71 and FIAT-9141 protocols

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <KWP71.h>
.B #include <Fiat9141.h>

.SH NOTES
This library requires a compatible serial device. It must follow the K-line signal standard (used by a number of ISO9141-based protocols), and also be driven by an FTDI USB-to-serial interface. The FTDI requirement is because of the need to use bit-banging to create 5 baud traffic for the slow init sequence.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This library provides an interface to the diagnostic serial port on a number of different automotive ECUs used during the 1990s.
